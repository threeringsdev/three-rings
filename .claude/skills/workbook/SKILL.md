# Working a Workbook Task

Use the `workbook` CLI as the task-state boundary. Never edit Workbook Git refs,
SQLite projections, or configuration directly.

## Select and read the task

1. If the invocation supplies a task ID or prefix, run
   `workbook show <supplied-id-or-prefix> --json`, then keep the canonical full
   ID from `data.id`.
2. Otherwise run `workbook next --json`, keep its full `data.id`, then run
   `workbook show <full-id> --json`.
3. Stop and report the error when Workbook is unavailable or uninitialized,
   selection or reading fails, or no task is eligible. Do not guess.
4. Use the resolved full ID for every later Workbook command.
5. Read the full title, description, status, dependencies, labels, and
   acceptance context before editing files.

## Follow the lifecycle

Before implementation, run:

```sh
workbook update <full-id> --status in-progress --json
```

Check the result before editing. Resume an already `in-progress` task without
inventing an operation. Do not silently reopen a blocked, deleted, or `done`
task. Leave an `in-review` task there when only checking acceptance or merge;
return it to `in-progress` before making requested implementation changes.

Follow the repository's instructions for planning, worktrees, implementation,
tests, commits, branches, pull requests, and merge verification.

| Milestone | Required Workbook action |
| --- | --- |
| Pull request is verified and ready for human review | `workbook update <full-id> --status in-review --json` |
| Review requires implementation changes | Move to `in-progress` before editing; return to `in-review` when ready |
| Work is accepted and the pull request is merged | `workbook update <full-id> --status done --json` |

Approval, passing CI, opening a pull request, or finishing locally is not a
merge. If acceptance and merge cannot both be verified, leave the task
`in-review` and report what remains.

## Publication is automatic

Task commands publish their own work. `create`, `update`, and the other
mutations fetch shared task refs, apply the change to the refreshed tip, and
push the single ref they changed; `next` fetches before answering. No extra
command is needed.

Pass `--no-sync` when a change must stay local. Record a project-wide policy
with `workbook config set auto-sync <true|false>`, never by editing
`.workbook/config.json`. Read the `sync` member of the
result envelope to confirm what happened: `status` is `completed`, `skipped`, or
`failed`. A `failed` status still means the change was recorded locally, and the
command exits 0. Exit code 6 means the task diverged from `origin` and was not
published; report that rather than retrying the mutation.

Run `workbook fetch`, `workbook sync`, or `workbook push` only when explicitly
asked, or to reconcile after exit code 6.

## Common mistakes

- Use canonical `in-progress` and `in-review`, not display labels.
- Keep using the resolved full task ID after selection.
- Check every JSON command result; do not assume a mutation succeeded.
- Do not claim that Workbook creates branches, pull requests, or merges code.
